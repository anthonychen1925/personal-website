Work / Lab Experience
Dr. Ruben Abagyan Lab — Undergraduate Researcher (Dec 2025 - Present)
- Learning Linux and the Protein Data Bank to extract data for specific biomedical targets and discover new drug leads; emphasis on multi-target pharmacology profiling.

UCSD Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry — Organic Chemistry Tutor (Oct 2025 - Present)
- Scheduling one-on-one $15/hour tutoring sessions for organic chemistry.

General Chemistry Lab
- Synthesized an Iron (III) Oxalate compound using oxalic acid to create Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to create an Fe (III)-oxalate compound, crystallized, vacuum filtered, and collected.
- Performed gravimetric analysis to determine molarity of aluminum in an unknown solution using 8-hydroxyquinoline to precipitate, vacuum filtered and massed.
- Performed acid-base titration by standardizing 0.1 M NaOH with KHP, titrating an unknown acid while collecting data with a pH probe and analyzing in Excel.

Plant Biology Lab
- Collected soil samples from local Lemonade Berry and California Sagebrush plants to extract and compare information on their soil conditions and soil microbiomes through statistical t-tests and chi-square analyses.
- Compared differences in carbon source metabolization between the soil microbiomes of both plants through microbial assays.
- Compared differences in microbial populations through microbial plating, PCR, gel electrophoresis, microbial assays, and Chi-square analysis.

Projects / Activities
Cerebrospinal Fluid Single-Cell RNA Sequencing ML Disease Classifier
- Developed a classifier with a team in UCSD's undergraduate 2025 bioinformatics hackathon by web scraping 1000+ single-cell RNA sequencing cerebrospinal fluid data from GEO datasets, merging into an AnnData matrix, visualizing with UMAP (Scanpy), and training a scikit-learn random forest classifier achieving ~70% accuracy.
- Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization.
